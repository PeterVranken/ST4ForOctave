<h1 id="what-is-stringtemplate-for-octave"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> What is StringTemplate-for-Octave?</h1>
<p>StringTemplate-for-Octave is a SourceForge open source project, which presents an interface between GNU Octave (<a href="http://www.Octave.org" class="uri">http://www.Octave.org</a>) and StringTemplate V4 (<a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org" class="uri">http://www.stringtemplate.org</a>). Although Octave is basically an environment for data analysis and development of mathematical algorithms is it due to its convenient and very efficient scripting language well suited for general scripting and text processing, too. (Here, “very efficient” is meant in terms of development effort and progress.) In this context, a template engine is a useful component.</p>
<p>StringTemplate V4 is a popular Java implementation of a powerful and convenient template engine. Intended output text is defined widely literal with intermingled template expressions. These expressions can refer to data objects, which are passed in to the template engine as native Java objects. Data object can be simple basic types or deeply nested data structures build from collections and showing recursive structures. This normally requires a compiled Java class, which a well-defined, statically typed data object can be instantiated from.</p>
<p>Using the Octave Java interface it is generally possible to build a Java object at run-time and to pass it to a Java class like the StringTemplate engine.</p>
<p>The interface presented automates this concept. It wraps widely arbitrary Octave data objects with appropriate Java data types and collections. While this is straight forward for linear lists (e.g. using a <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>) it does need much more consideration when it comes to Octave struct objects with run-time defined fields (i.e. no compiled Java class is available by principle). All the processing is done recursively so that deeply nested data objects can be passed to the template engine just like that.</p>
<p>A major sample presents a compiler fragment, which passes its complete parse tree as a single “attribute” – i.e. the data object to be rendered in the terminology of StringTemplate – to the template engine for code generation.</p>
<h1 id="current-revision"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Current revision</h1>
<p>The current revision of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/stringtemplate-for-octave/">downloadable files</a> is SVN r45. Please refer to the SVN log for latest changes.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-run-the-stringtemplate-v4-engine-from-gnu-octave"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> How to run the StringTemplate V4 engine from GNU Octave?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The interface is implemented by a few Octave script files, mainly <code>st4Render.m</code> and <code>st4RenderWrite.m</code>. They are accompanied by some minor support scripts. Copy the contents of the archive to an appropriate location and update your Octave search path so that the scripts are found. Consider running the support script <code>st4addpath</code> from the root of the archive to do so once in a new Octave session. Or consider using the native Octave commands <code>addpath</code> and <code>savepath</code> to update the search path persistently</li>
<li>Support script <code>st4addpath</code> will set the search path not only for the executable Octave scripts but for the StringTemplate V4 template group files used by the different samples, too. Without running <code>st4addpath</code> some samples will fail to locate the required templates</li>
<li><p>Open an Octave session. Ensure that the Java class path contains</p>
<ul>
<li>the StringTemplate V4 jar file, <code>ST-4.0.8.jar</code></li>
<li>the interface jar file, <code>ST4ForOctave-1.0.jar</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The current Java class path can be double-checked with typing <code>javaclasspath</code> in the Octave command line window.</p>
<p>Several ways exist to modify the Java class path of Octave. You may do this on the fly with the support script <code>st4javaaddpath</code> from the root of the archive or you rely on the Octave startup file <code>javaclasspath.txt</code>. We provide you a template for this file but it needs customization before use and it’ll work only if the Octave executable is started from this directory. Windows users can have a look at (and double-click) <code>runOctave.cmd</code> to do so. Everybody should consult <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.1/How-to-make-Java-classes-available_003f.html" class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.1/How-to-make-Java-classes-available_003f.html</a> to get the whole story on setting the Java class path</p></li>
<li>In Octave, <code>cd</code> to directory <code>samples</code> and run the different Octave scripts. They will easily throw an error if something is still wrong with the paths! Open the scripts in a text editor and find out what they want to demonstrate</li>
<li><p>If the basic samples are running well you can have a closer look at the major sample <code>compiler</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems-with-java-class-path-using-stringtemplate-v4-with-octave-for-windows"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Problems with Java class path using StringTemplate V4 with Octave for Windows</h2>
<p>In the SVN revisions prior to 39 we had documented a strange and untransparent behavior of the StringTemplate V4 engine with respect to locating template files via the Java class path. This was considered a problem with setting the Java class path in Octave. Making now new investigations it appeared to be another problem. Using the Octave command <code>javaMethod (&quot;getProperty&quot;, &quot;java.lang.System&quot;, &quot;java.class.path&quot;)</code> it could be proven that the class path was correctly set but the ST4 engine still didn’t read the template files. From the error reports it even appeared that it could locate the files in the class path but then it failed because it tried loading the files always from the startup directory of Octave. Either this was the right path or the template expansion failed.</p>
<p>We couldn’t find an explanation and can’t offer a fix.</p>
<p>From SVN r39 on, we circumvent the problem by passing only absolute paths to the ST4 engine. The user specified template files are located using the Octave search path and if found the absolute path is sent to the engine. Consequently, the Java class path no longer needs to be configured for template files. (It only requires two entries for the jar files that implement the interface and the ST4 engine. This works straightforward.)</p>
<p>The import statement in a template group file to load sub-ordinated group files typically makes use of relative paths. These paths are understood as relative to the group file, which contains the import statement. This behavior matches the expectations but it is no longer possible to hold a general purpose template library somewhere in the depth of the file system and just add the root path of the library to the Java class path as it usually is possible with the ST4 engine.</p>
<p>Using this avoidance strategy all samples and tests worked very well and in full accordance with user expectations but the documented behavior of the StringTemplate V4 engine is significantly changed by this decision!</p>
<h2 id="wrong-locale"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Wrong Locale</h2>
<p>Java’s and thus StringTemplate’s behavior are region dependent. The representation of numbers and dates depends on where the software is executed. This affects the generated output when using the renderers for printf-like, formatted output. Mainly floating point numbers looking like 31,415e-1 are quite annoying. Region dependent software behavior will be undesired in the majority of use cases. You can make your StringTemplate V4 templates region independent by setting the default region US in the Java virtual machine of the Octave session. Before using any of the functions in this package put some code like this in your Octave script:</p>
<pre><code>% Call of static method getDefault of class Locale to see which country we
% operate the software in.
locale = javaMethod(&#39;getDefault&#39;, &#39;java.util.Locale&#39;);

% It should be US to avoid problems with representation of numbers and
% dates, we switch to the US standard. Local differences will easy affect
% the output of StringTemplate V4, which will be desirable for barely any
% use case.
if ~strcmp(locale.getLanguage(), &#39;us&#39;)
    % Create a US Locale object...
    localeUSObj = javaObject(&#39;java.util.Locale&#39;, &#39;US&#39;);
    % ... and pass it to the static class method setDefault.
    javaMethod(&#39;setDefault&#39;, &#39;java.util.Locale&#39;, localeUSObj);
end

% Now, we should surely use the US representation of numbers and dates.
locale = javaMethod(&#39;getDefault&#39;, &#39;java.util.Locale&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Consider running <code>testST4Render</code> to test your system’s behavior. It proves that floating point numbers use the dot as separator.</p>
<p>The commands to define the Java locale are made available to the library users as command <code>st4SetLocaleUS</code>. Using this script, a typical startup sequence for an application using ST4ForOctave could resemble this code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>% Anchor of initialization: Make library scripts available to the
% Octave interpreter.
run &lt;myInstallationPathOfST4ForOctave&gt;\st4addpath.m
st4javaaddpath
st4SetLocaleUS
% Down here, the StringTemplate V4 engine is usable. Let&#39;s try:
testST4Render
testST4RenderWrite</code></pre>
<h1 id="documentation"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Documentation</h1>
<ul>
<li>In Octave, type <code>help st4Render</code> and <code>help st4RenderWrite</code> to get the online help about the StringTemplate interface for Octave</li>
<li>See folder <code>doc</code>. Some help on the StringTemplate engine has been added. You will need to study the documentation in order to learn about templates and template expressions</li>
<li>A service object of Java class <code>info.Info</code> is passed to the ST4 templates as additional attribute <code>info</code>. The fields and services this object provides to the template are described in the Javadoc documentation at <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/stringtemplate-for-octave/code/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html" class="uri">https://svn.code.sf.net/p/stringtemplate-for-octave/code/trunk/doc/dataModel/index.html</a>. Consider this Javadoc as the manual of the info object</li>
<li>Study the well documented source code of the interface scripts and the samples</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="please-note"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Please note</h1>
<p>The data structures, which can be exchanged with the StringTemplate engine are widely arbitrary, which means that you can feel free in modeling your data. However, there are important limitations; we can’t pass any imaginable Octave object through the given Java interface. For example class objects of Octave are not supported but struct objects are. Type <code>help st4Render</code> to get a list of known limitations.</p>
<p>The limitations won’t be very painful but it means that you must not expect to reuse all of your existing data models without any kind of re-work when passing the data to the template engine.</p>
<p>The interface can be used with MATLAB, too. Besides the documented limitations of the StringTemplate V4 interface itself lack elder MATLAB revisions the 64 Bit integer operations, which are required to run some of the samples. Moreover, MATLAB 2012 still comes with an incompatible old Java version and can’t be used. MATLAB 2015 is fine and we don’t have information about 2013 and 2014.</p>

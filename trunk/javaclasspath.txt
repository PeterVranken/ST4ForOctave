% in is the current working directory when the Octave application is
% started. This condition is met if you use the Windows shortcut in this
% directory to open Octave. If you open Octave from the Windows Start menu
% and then cd here, it won't read this file and it won't be able to locate
% the StringTemplate jar file.

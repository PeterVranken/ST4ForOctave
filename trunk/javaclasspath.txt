% This file defines the Java class path for Octave. It make Octave find
% the StringTemplate V4 library.
%   Please note, this file is considered only if the directory it resides
% in is the current working directory when the Octave application is
% started. This condition is met if you use the Windows shortcut in this
% directory to open Octave. If you open Octave from the Windows Start menu
% and then cd here, it won't read this file and it won't be able to locate
% the StringTemplate jar file.
%   Please refer to
% https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.1/How-to-make-Java-classes-available_003f.html
% to get more information how to set the class path in your local
% environment.
%   An alternative way of doing is placing this code fragment into your
% session or project startup code:
%   st4javaaddpath

% TODO Replace <installDirOfST4InterfaceForOctave> with your actual path
% and uncomment the lines
%<installDirOfST4InterfaceForOctave>\StringTemplate\antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar
%<installDirOfST4InterfaceForOctave>\StringTemplate\ST4ForOctave-1.0.jar
